# custom_cursor_testing

Known Issue:
if you look in the /src directory while script is running, you can watch
the .svg files get recolored both during dark-theme creation and custom
coloring, yet after script is complete, theme that is installed still
looks like the default theme. trying to track down why. Had this issue
in previous version, can't recall what the problem was, but is still 
weird since the code-base should be the same.

testing repo for custom_cursor project. use caution if using anything from this repo.

if testing the script, use arrow keys or mouse to select light/dark
version, then use arrow-keys to highlight color choice, press space
to select, and enter to continue (or again, just use your mouse)

if using a custom-color, a dialog will appear asking you to enter
a custom hex-code for the color. enter your hex-code (including the #)
and press enter or click ok. (the dialog will display until a valid
hex-code has been entered)
